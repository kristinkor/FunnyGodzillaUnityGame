## Game Pitch
Help the Godzilla to fly away from the Earth to its Planet. This game is a mix of a famous Mario game and Flappy bird. Your main character is a Godzilla which woke up and soon became very tired of the unknown planet and wants to get home. Try to complete all levels, kill the King Kings on your way, and not to hit the Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty and WTC. Good luck!


## Objective
The main goal is to complete all levels and get the highest score. There are three levels to complete. Two of them are something similar to Mario. One is played in mountains, the second one in New York. The third level is a modification of a Flappy Bird but instead of bird you are the starship. Avoid falling down and avoid the obstacles like buildings. Level is completed when you gain all points or get to the end of the scene without falling down.
